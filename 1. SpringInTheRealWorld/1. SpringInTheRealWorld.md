# Spring in the real world 

Application framework is a set of common software functionalities that provides a foundation structure for developing an application. 

Application framework eases the effort of writting an application by taking out the effort of writing all the program code from scratch 

## Why should we use frameworks?

Application framework offers a set of functionalities and tools on top of which we can build applications, those perks can be used to build apps

#### One framework can help you easily with other software concepts such as:
- security
- caching
- logging 

In general the business logic is rather smaller compared to the overall infrastructure of one application 

## The Spring Ecosystem 

#### Spring is a giant ecosystem of frameworks that contains a lot of smaller frameworks, some of them are:
- *Spring Core*: Contains **Spring Context** that enables Spring to *manage instances of your app*. **Spring Aspects** help Spring *intercept and manipulate methods you define in your app*
- **Spring model-view-controller *(MVC)***: This framework enables development of web applications *that serve HTTP request*
- **Spring Data Access**: Provides basic tools that can be used to *connect to SQL Database*
- **Spring testing**: holds the tools that are needed for *writing UTs*

*You can imagine the Spring framework as a solar system with the Spring Core in the center*

## Discovering Spring Core: The foundation of Spring 

Spring works on the principle **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, this means that control is given to Spring to ***control the app and its code***

Instead of the programmer being responsible for the object creation, *Spring has IoC container that creates and manages those objects*

**The IoC container *(known also as Spring Context)* glues components (yours and of the framework) together**

Using the **IoC container** makes certain objects *known to Spring*

## Using Spring Data Access feature to implement the app's persistence

Working with databases is fundamental subject and *Spring Data Access* module will help you to take care of data persistence 

Spring Data uses **JDBC, integrating with ORM *(object-relational mapping)* framework like Hibernate and managing transactions**

Spring Data also uses **SQL and NoSQL** technologies to *simplify the way of working with data persistence*

## The Spring MVC capabilities for developing web apps

The most common applications developed with Spring are web apps

**Spring MVC** uses *standard servlet functionalities*

## The Spring testing feature 

The Spring testing module offers us a large set of tools that we’ll use to write unit and
integration tests

## Spring Boot 

Spring Boot offers a default configuration that can be customize as needed instead of setting up all the configuration
